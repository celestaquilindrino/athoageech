Hey, I've started playing the guitar a week or so ago and I'm learning it by myself plus the tips my brother gives me when he comes over. Thing is I can't really tune it by ear and I haven't managed to find free good apps for tuning. Is the 2,99e fee for Guitar Tuna worth it? I'n using android. Are the little clip on tuners that cost  to  any good? How about the tuners in free apps like GuitarTuna and Fender Tune? I use all of the above but have noticed they tune some of the strings a little differently - especially the low E string. I downloaded GuitarTuna to tune my guitar and it seems to work ok. Has anyone used it and compared it to a real tuner? I also downloaded Ultimate Guitar: chords and tabs seems to have good stuff on there. Honestly I'd like to support these devs and use these apps for a while but can anyone tell me if they are worth investing Do I need a special kind of tuner to check intonation at the 12th fret? This is my first attempt at setting my intonation. Seems easy enough, but when I check the intonation at the 12th fret, it is so far off that no amount of adjusting the saddle forward or backwards gets it even remotely close. It is a tune-o-matic bridge if that helps and I have tried flipping it. Action is relatively high as I prefer it that way. I am currently using the free version of GuitarTuna. My friend I know that guitar tuna makes you pay, and fender tuner has an option for you to tune down a step by ear, but I can’t find any apps that shown you how to tune down a step accurately. Hey guys, first post! So I've been working on a jazz opera, if that's a term (think Channel One Suite). A little background, I know the basics of music theory, like scales, intervals, and chords. However, my music theory knowledge when it comes to writing progressions is relatively limited. Anyway, I've got this eight bar chord progression that I wrote and I'm not sure exactly if it's functional. I wanted it to sound ambiguous and unresolved, but I'm afraid the end result might be so ambiguous. 
I was using GuitarTuna, because I liked that you could automatic tune (handsfree), but I noticed it was giving me slightly different tuning for a couple chords compared to Pocket Ukulele Tuner. I was wondering if you guys have any suggestions, pref free apps with handsfree tuning. So I’ve been trying to intonate my guitar, after watching some guides they say to play the open strings and match the note to the octave at the 12th fret, but the problem is I’m playing the low E and it’s showing up as a very sharp D at the 12th fret, what is causing this? No amount of saddle bridge movement either direction has changed it. update I actually figured out what the problem was, I was using GuitarTuna app to do the tuning and it was giving me wildly off notes I know a lot of bassists that have some trouble with the GuitarTuna app when tuning their basses so I thought I'd share a pretty simple solution I found for it. A lot of phones have trouble picking up those really low notes on some amps and basses so what you can do to fix this and even get a more accurate tuning is to just play the 12th fret harmonic while using the actual Guitar tuner instead of the Bass tuner. It's much easier for the phone mic to pick up so you can tune easier. EDIT:. Hello all I’m coming to the end of the month with a few € left on my PAYG plan which I can use on the play store What are some essential paid apps to spend it on? Already I have nova prime, guitar tuna pro and stickmount I just got my first Guitar on Monday and before I could start playing one of the strings had been damaged in the box and snapped as soon as I picked it. So before I've even tried to play a single chord I've had to restring the damn thing. I've been told that beginners are best getting Light and Super Light strings to get to grips with shit. Plus I want to play some Flamenco/Spanish style stuff and Light strings are meant to be more fitting for that from what I've read at least. After fucking. 
So I'm trying to get better at identifying chords by ear. The app I use to tune my guitar, GuitarTuna, has a game where it plays chord sounds and you guess the chord. I generally like it, but I think it'd be nice if there were some more options. Does anyone know of any similar apps they'd recommend? I want to see what options are out there before I spring for the paid version of GuitarTuna. Total beginner here. I got a Yamaha TRBX504 today, and no matter which tuner app I used (guitar tuna, fender, etc) it always told me my strings were way too low. E was unrecognizable, sometimes it was D, A is seen as E, D seen as A, G seen as D. I tried pulling the E string tighter this morning and it snapped before it was even properly tuned. Got it replaced but I don't want to remake the same mistake. What's wrong with my strings? My ears are not trained enough to recognized all the proper. Hey guys. I bought and played around with a guitar for the first time yesterday and am getting the feel of the tuning. I've got all other strings tuned but I can't seem to get the d-string right. I'm using the Guitar Tuna app and it says its pitch is too low, despite tightening it as much as I could, and I feel like if I tighten it any more the string will snap. Why is this string in particular is so out of tune and the others aren't? Any recommendations? Much appreciated. Hey guys, working through some beginner lessons online, so I pick up my guitar this morning, to work on some chords, and notice that the second string from the top is wobbling more than the rest. And more than I’ve noticed before. I use the GuitarTuna app to make sure my guitar is always in tune. Is this wobble a normal thing? If not, any ideas on what to do to fix it? Thanks. I bought my guitar a day or two ago and I tuned it with the "GuitarTuna" app and then went out. When I came back I opened the app again and it showed that some of my strings were not tuned. Is there something I'm not supposed to be doing? Or could it be a faulty guitar. 
So I got a guitar for my birthday and I love it to death I sincerely do and I’m getting another one for my birthday coming up in a little bit, but this really gets on my nerves! So I downloaded a couple of apps that I was previously happy with guitar Tuna and Yousician , everything was perfect I could tune my guitar and I could learn any song I wanted to fast and easily. But then a month after that I went to try and learn a song from an artist for example Eminem wasn’t there , Nirvana wasn’t. I have GuitarTuna on my iPhone and it has a setting for tuning a 5 string Bass but I can pretty much only tune the D and G before it has trouble finding the pitch of the lower strings. Are there any other Tuning Apps that "hear" those lower frequencies. Today I picked up my guitar again after several months ~~years~~ of not playing. Any suggestion which tuner app you use? Or are they accurate? Thanks! EDIT: Sticking to Guitar Tuna for now. Appreciate everyone's responses. Thank
